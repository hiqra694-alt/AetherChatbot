"""
Connector Manager.

Owns connections to zero or more *external* MCP servers over the HTTP/SSE
transport, discovers their tool schemas, and merges those schemas alongside
AetherChat's own native tool registry (api.chat.tools.ALL_TOOLS) into one
list shaped for the LLM -- optionally filtered down to a per-request set of
enabled connectors (Phase 3).

Static connectors only (e.g. a generic MCP_SERVER_URLS entry such as Brave
Search): connected once at app startup, held in the MCPClientManager
singleton's `_connections` for the process's lifetime, and shared read-only
across every request.

The Google Managed MCP (Workspace/Gmail) and GitHub MCP connectors that
used to also live here -- each opened as a short-lived, per-user session
via create_workspace_session/create_github_session/create_gmail_mcp_session
-- have been removed: Google Workspace is being rebuilt as native Python
tools instead (see connector_integrations/intent_router.py, repurposed to
route those), and GitHub is dropped entirely. The frontend's
google_gmail/google_calendar/google_drive toggles, and the
backend/api/connectors OAuth-token endpoints and user_oauth_tokens table
they rely on, are unaffected by this removal and are reused as-is by
whatever replaces this wiring.

Strictly additive: nothing in this module mutates the existing Groq
provider, RAG pipeline, native tools, or Supabase wiring. Each external
server is identified by a stable `connector_id` (e.g. "brave_search")
rather than its raw URL, so the frontend can toggle connectors on/off by a
human-readable id and a server's tools can be traced back to the connector
that offers them.
